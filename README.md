      perform_action: media_player.open_equalizer
      target:

```

## Music Assistant Integration

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/83ae321a-3abf-4e73-8493-6ef54efa5140)

Both the Mediocre Media Player Card and the Mediocre Massive Media Player Card support Music Assistant. By specifying a `ma_entity_id`, you can enable Music Assistant-specific features (currently just search). Even if your main entity_id is the same as your music assistant entity_id you need to specify it in the `ma_entity_id`. This allows you to use the card with a different entity_id than your music assistant but trigger actions on a music assistant entity.

### Configuration

```yaml
type: "custom:mediocre-media-player-card"
entity_id: media_player.living_room_musiccast
ma_entity_id: media_player.living_room_musicassistant
```

| Option         | Type   | Default | Description                                 |
| -------------- | ------ | ------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| `ma_entity_id` | string | -       | The entity ID of the Music Assistant player |

### Mediocre Chip Media Player Group Card

A compact chip-style card for quickly grouping/ungrouping speakers. Perfect for dashboards where space is limited but you need quick access to speaker controls.

#### Configuration

```yaml
type: "custom:mediocre-chip-media-player-group-card"
entity_id: media_player.living_room_speaker
entities:
  - media_player.kitchen_speaker
  - media_player.bedroom_speaker
  - media_player.bathroom_speaker
```

#### Configuration Options

| Option      | Type   | Default  | Description                                                  |
| ----------- | ------ | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `entity_id` | string | Required | The entity ID of the main media player to group others with  |
| `entities`  | array  | Required | List of entity IDs that can be grouped with the main speaker |

## Search Functionality

Both the Mediocre Media Player Card and the Mediocre Massive Media Player Card support search functionality. By specifying a `ma_entity_id`, you can enable Music Assistant-specific search features directly within the card. Alternatively, enabling the `search.enabled` option will use the regular Home Assistant `search_media` functionality. Read more about configuring the cards for search [here](./docs/README_SEARCH.md).

## Troubleshooting

If you run into issues:

1. Check that your entity supports the media player features needed
2. Verify your configuration syntax
3. Look for errors in your browser's developer console

## Development

These cards are built with Preact wrapped in web components. For local development:

```bash
# Install dependencies
yarn install

# Build for development
yarn dev

# Continually build when files change
yarn dev:watch

# Build for production
yarn build
```

When using `yarn dev`, the output file will be named `mediocre-hass-media-player-cards-dev.js` instead of `mediocre-hass-media-player-cards.js`.

You can also create a `.env.development` file (based on the `.env.development.example`) to use custom component names during development. This is usefull if you want to test in a live environment without risking breaking anything for your users (family members :D).
