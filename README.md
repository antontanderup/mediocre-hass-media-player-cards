## Troubleshooting

If you run into issues:

1. Check that your entity supports the media player features needed
2. Verify your configuration syntax
3. Look for errors in your browser's developer console

## Development

These cards are built with Preact wrapped in web components. For local development:

```bash
# Install dependencies
yarn install

# Build for development
yarn dev

# Continually build when files change
yarn dev:watch

# Build for production
yarn build
```

When using `yarn dev`, the output file will be named `mediocre-hass-media-player-cards-dev.js` instead of `mediocre-hass-media-player-cards.js`.

You can also create a `.env.development` file (based on the `.env.development.example`) to use custom component names during development. This is usefull if you want to test in a live environment without risking breaking anything for your users (family members :D).
