## More Features & Documentation

- [Universal Media Player integration](./docs/README_UMP.md)
- [Search functionality](./docs/README_SEARCH.md)

## Troubleshooting

If you run into issues:

1. Check that your entity supports the media player features needed
2. Verify your configuration syntax
3. Look for errors in your browser's developer console

## Development

These cards are built with Preact wrapped in web components. For local development:

```bash
# Install dependencies


# Build for development
- [Using Universal Media Player with Mediocre Media Player Cards](./docs/README_UMP.md)

# Continually build when files change
- [Search Functionality with Mediocre Media Player Cards](./docs/README_SEARCH.md)

# Build for production

```

When using `yarn dev`, the output file will be named `mediocre-hass-media-player-cards-dev.js` instead of `mediocre-hass-media-player-cards.js`.

You can also create a `.env.development` file (based on the `.env.development.example`) to use custom component names during development. This is useful if you want to test in a live environment without risking breaking anything for your users (family members :D).
